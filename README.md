# Problem Statement

In this section we are going to explain what kind of problem we are trying to solve, what is required to solve this problem.

## What are we trying to solve? 

On an high level, we want to visualize the decision process made by a cognitive robot. 
In concrete terms, this involves visualizing the prior knowledge and the inferred knowledge seperately. 
Querying the ontology with SPARQL or running inference over the an ontology should be made possible.
For now support inference only over SWRL.

## What are the requirements for solving this problem?

- Importing an ontology in a specific format, which can be visualized in Javascript.
- Importing multiple ontologies and highlight relations between ontologies.
- Toggling classes, instances to add to prior knowledge
- Regarding SPARQL - use prior knowledge and knowledge which wants to be known, to find all relevant relations
- Creating instances for SWRL.
- Regarding SWRL - Highlight premise and consequence.
